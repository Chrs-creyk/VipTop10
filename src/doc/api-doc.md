 {"id":1,"name":"Colombia","description":"Colombia, officially the Republic of Colombia, is a country in South America with insular regions in North Americaâ€”near Nicaragua's Caribbean coastâ€”as well as in the Pacific Ocean. The Colombian mainland is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the north, Venezuela to the east and northeast, Brazil to the southeast, Ecuador and Peru to the south and southwest, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and Panama to the northwest. Colombia is divided into 32 departments and the Capital District of BogotÃ¡, the country's largest city. It covers an area of 1,141,748 square kilometers (440,831 sq mi), and has a population of 52 million. Colombia's cultural heritageâ€”including language, religion, cuisine, and artâ€”reflects its history as a Spanish colony, fusing cultural elements brought by immigration from Europe and the Middle East, with those brought by enslaved Africans, as well as with those of the various Indigenous civilizations that predate colonization. Spanish is the official state language, although English and 64 other languages are recognized regional languages.","stateCapital":"BogotÃ¡","surface":1141748,"population":52235050,"languages":["Spanish","English"],"timeZone":"UTC-5","currency":"Colombian Peso","currencyCode":"COP","isoCode":"CO","internetDomain":".co","phonePrefix":"+57","radioPrefix":"HK","aircraftPrefix":"HK"}
